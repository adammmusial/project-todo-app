# React To-Do App
<a href="https://react-todo-app-am.netlify.app/">Live Demo</a>

## About the Project
I created a to-do app using React to manage tasks with statuses like "To-do", "Doing", and "Done". The app saves tasks to local storage, so your tasks persist between sessions. You can add tasks, tag them, and delete them. This project helped me learn about state management in React and how to create reusable components.

## Key Learnings
- **State Management**: Mastered the use of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for efficient task data management and persistence.
- **Persistent State**: Utilized local storage to save tasks, ensuring a seamless user experience across sessions.
- **Event Handling**: Enhanced skills in event handling by creating features for adding, updating, deleting, and tagging tasks.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed a responsive interface using CSS Modules, ensuring an optimal user experience across different devices.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implemented conditional rendering to dynamically manage and display task statuses based on their state.
